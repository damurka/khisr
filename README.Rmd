The khisr package is designed to seamlessly integrate with the Kenya Health Information System (KHIS), providing R users with a powerful interface for efficient data retrieval. KHIS is a cornerstone in health information management in Kenya, and khisr simplifies the process of accessing and working with KHIS data directly within the R environment.

## Installation

You can install the release version of khisr from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("khisr")
```

And the development version of khisr like so:

``` r
#install.packages('pak')
pak::pak('damurka/khisr')
```

## Usage

### Load khisr package

```{r}
library("khisr")
```

### Auth

khisr will, by default, help you interact with KHIS as an authenticated user. 
Before calling any function that makes an API call you need credentials to 
[KHIS](https://hiskenya.org). You will be expected to set this credential to 
download data. See the article
[set you credentials](https://khisr.damurka.com/articles/set-your-credentials.html)
for more

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Set the credentials using username and password
khis_cred(username = 'KHIS username', password = 'KHIS password')

# Set credentials using configuration path
khis_cred(config_path = 'path/to/secret.json')
```

After setting the credential you can invoke any function to download data from the API.

For this overview, we've logged into KHIS as a specific user in a hidden chunk.

## Basic Overview

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
# Retrieve the organisation units by county (level 2)
counties <- get_organisation_units(level %.eq% '2')
counties

# Retrieve organisation units by name (level included to ensure it refers to county)
kiambu_county <- get_organisation_units(level %.eq% '2', 
                                        name %.like% 'Kiambu')
kiambu_county

# Retrieve all data elements by data element group for outpatient (data element group name MOH 705)
moh_705 <- get_data_elements(dataElementGroups.name %.like% 'moh 705')
moh_705

# Filter the data element to element that contain malaria
malaria <- get_data_elements(dataElementGroups.name %.like% 'moh 705', 
                             name %.like% 'malaria')
malaria

# Retrieve data for malaria in Kiambu county in the outpatient data element groups
data <- get_analytics(
        dx %.d% malaria$id,
        pe %.d% 'LAST_YEAR',
        ou %.f% kiambu_county$id
    ) %>%
    left_join(malaria, by = c('dx'='id'))
data
```
