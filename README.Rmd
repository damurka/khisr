The khisr package is designed to seamlessly integrate with DHIS2, providing R users with a powerful interface for efficient data retrieval. DHIS2 is a cornerstone in health information management for many organisations, and khisr simplifies the process of accessing and working with DHIS2 data directly within the R environment.

### Key Features

- ***Data Retrieval:*** Easily download and manage data from DHIS2.
- ***Flexible Queries:*** Customize data queries to retrieve specific data elements,   periods, and organizational units.
- ***Secure Access:*** Manage credentials securely within your R environment.

### Use Cases

- Health data analysis for research.
- Monitoring and evaluation of health programs
- Generating reports and dashboards for health information systems.

## Installation

### Stable Release

You can install the release version of khisr from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("khisr")
```

### Development Version
And the development version of khisr like so:

``` r
#install.packages('pak')
pak::pak('damurka/khisr')
```

## Usage

### Load khisr package

```{r}
library("khisr")
```

### Auth

The khisr package operates in authenticated mode by default. This means you'll need to provide credentials before using any functions that interact with your DHIS2 instance to download data. To ensure secure access, khisr offers a convenient way to store your credentials within your R environment. Refer to the following resource for detailed instructions on setting your credentials: [set you credentials](https://khisr.damurka.com/articles/set-your-credentials.html)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Option 1: Set credentials directly in R (less secure)

khis_cred(username = 'DHIS2 username', 
          password = 'DHIS2 password', 
          server = 'https://<dhis2 server instance>')

# Option 2: Set credentials from a secure configuration file (recommended)

khis_cred(config_path = 'path/to/secret.json')
```

Once you've established your credentials, you're ready to leverage khisr's functions to download data from your DHIS2 instance.

For this overview, we've logged into DHIS2 as a specific user in a hidden chunk.

## Basic Overview

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
# Retrieve the organisation units by county (level 2)
counties <- get_organisation_units(level %.eq% '2')
counties

# Retrieve organisation units by name (level included to ensure it refers to county)
kiambu_county <- get_organisation_units(level %.eq% '2', 
                                        name %.like% 'Kiambu')
kiambu_county

# Retrieve all data elements by data element group for outpatient (data element group name MOH 705)
moh_705 <- get_data_elements(dataElementGroups.name %.like% 'moh 705')
moh_705

# Filter the data element to element that contain malaria
malaria <- get_data_elements(dataElementGroups.name %.like% 'moh 705', 
                             name %.like% 'malaria')
malaria

# Retrieve data for malaria in Kiambu county in the outpatient data element groups
data <- get_analytics(
        dx %.d% malaria$id,
        pe %.d% 'LAST_YEAR',
        ou %.f% kiambu_county$id
    ) %>%
    left_join(malaria, by = c('dx'='id'))
data
```
